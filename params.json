To get the name of the file use the following rules:\r\n\r\n- reverse the domain name\r\n- create a directory for each part (if it does not exist already) **except for the last part)\r\n- add a filename of the last part you just omitted and add the `.json` extension\r\n\r\nIf guides.github.com wanted contribute their update, they would create a file with the name `guides.json` inside the directory path `com/github`.\r\n\r\nThe content is a plain JSON object and can contain the following keys:\r\n\r\n- **`domain`** - The name of the domain in a human readable form\r\n- **`time`** â€“ The time after which communications are assumed to be save again (if unknown use `null`)\r\n- **`includeSubdomain`** - If also all subdomains have been secured (`true` or `false`)\r\n- **`source`** - Where this information comes from (e.g. a blogpost)\r\n\r\nAn example for guides.github.com would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"domain\": \"guides.github.com\",\r\n    \"time\": null,\r\n    \"includeSubdomain\": false,\r\n    \"source\": \"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/blog\\/1818-security-heartbleed-vulnerability\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\nIf you want to provide feedback to this repository: please just create an [new issue](https://github.com/tobiastom/heartbleed/issues/new).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
